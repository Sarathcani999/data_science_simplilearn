- Why SciPy needed
- Characteristics of SciPy
- Subpackages of SciPy ( IO , integration , linear algebra , statistics etc: )


Scientific Domains
	* Statistics : Enables Scientists to build hypothesis based on statistical model
	* Spatial : Enables Scientists to plot data for better analysis
	* Platform Integrations : At some point of time  we need to use/import matlab and cpp files
	* Mathematical equations : This include solving linear equaitons , integration, finding determinants inverse etc :

Problem : A box's length is twice its width. Sum of three dimension = 60 . What is the min volume?

Solution :
Let,	x = box width
	2*x = box length
	h = box height
Given,	x + 2*x + h = 60
	h = 60 - 3*x		--------------------(1)
Maximise the volume,	V = x*(2*x)*h
			V = 2*(x**2)*h
(replacing h with given information using equation (1))
			V = 2*(x**2)*(60 - 3*x)
			V = 120*(x**2) - 6*(x**3)
(differentiating V w.r.t x)
			V' = 240*(x) - 18*(x**2)
			Let V' = 0
			0 = 240*(x) - 18*(x**2)
			0 = x*(240 - 18*x)
			x = 0 , x = 13.333

			V'' = 240 - 36*x
			x = 0 is minimum value 			{V'' is +ve}
			x = 13.33 is maximum value 		{V'' is -ve}
